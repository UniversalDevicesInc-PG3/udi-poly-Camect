# Configure the Camect Node Server

You must set the following:

- user: The Camect local user.
- password: The Camect local user password

- Camect Host
    - Click 'Add Camect Host' for each of your Camect Hosts. Using camect.local may work if you only have one depending on your network. But probably best to use an IP address or hostname that is reserved in your router.

As noted in the [Camect Python client library](https://github.com/camect/camect-py/blob/master/README.md) Please open [Local Camect](https://local.home.camect.com/) in browser, sign in as admin and accept TOS before you proceed.  [Use a different user besides admin?](https://github.com/jimboca/udi-poly-Camect/issues/5)
